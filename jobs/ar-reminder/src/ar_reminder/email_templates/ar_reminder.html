Hello,

## This is your reminder to file your {{year}} BC Annual Report for {{business_legal_name}}.

You will file your annual report on the new Business Registry, a B.C. Government digital service used to start a business and keep business records up to date.

---

## TO FILE:
1. **Before you file, your BC Services Card digital ID must be set up**. If you have not set it up, use the [BC Services Card (BCSC) app](https://id.gov.bc.ca/account/) now. If you are set up, click the link below to file.
The BCSC digital ID is a secure and easy way to login and access the Business Registry. It protects your identity and ensures no one can impersonate you when accessing services online.


2. **Click [here]({{access_url}}) to file your annual report.**
You can file using your mobile device or desktop computer. A basic account will be set up when you file. Before you file, [read more](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/business/managing-a-business/permits-licences/news-updates/modernization-updates/using-the-business-registry#account) to ensure a Basic account is right for you.

---
More filings and services will be added to the Business Registry soon, including a dashboard that provides quick and easy access to your business records. If youâ€™d like to see a new feature or enhancement added, [let us know](https://github.com/bcgov/business-ar/discussions/categories/ideas)

**Do you have a reminder with an access code?** While these access codes can still be used in [Corporate Online](http://www.corporateonline.gov.bc.ca), we encourage you to file your annual report in the NEW Business Registry to get early access and avoid delays accessing your company records, as Corporate Online will no longer be used to manage your business early in 2025.

**Questions & Technical Support?** Contact the BC OnLine help desk at 1-800-663-6102 from 8:30 am to 4:30 pm Pacific time, Monday to Friday, except statutory holidays.

**Not able to file online?** Contact a [Service BC location](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/ministries/citizens-services/servicebc).
