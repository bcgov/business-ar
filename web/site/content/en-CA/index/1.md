### To file Your BC Annual Report you'll need to:
* Set up your digital ID using the <a href="https://id.gov.bc.ca/static/help/setup_app.html" target="_blank"> BC Services Card app </a>. This is a secure and easy way to prove who you are online, it protects your identity and makes sure no one else can access services as you.
