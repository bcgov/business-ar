### To file Your BC Annual Report you'll need to:
* Set up your digital ID using the <a href = "https://id.gov.bc.ca/static/help/setup_app.html"> BC Services Card app </a>. This is a secure and easy way to prove who you are online, it protects your identity and makes sure no one esle can access services as you.
* Once your <a href = "https://id.gov.bc.ca/account/">BC Services Card Account </a> app is set up on your mobile or desktop, you are ready to file on the Business Registry.
